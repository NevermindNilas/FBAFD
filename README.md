## Introduction
Flow Based Anime Frame Deduplication (FBAFD) is a tool designed to improve the accuracy of frame deduplication in anime videos. Traditional methods like Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) often fall short, especially at higher resolutions such as 1920x1080. FBAFD leverages advanced flow-based techniques to provide more reliable deduplication results.

This is still in testing, let me cook!.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes flow-based algorithms to detect duplicate frames with higher precision.
- **Resolution Agnostic**: Performs well across various resolutions, including 1920x1080 and higher.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use with a simple command-line interface.
